# cigar_box_combo
Cigar box-based combination lock that uses a Circuit Playground Express (Adafruit)

This repository includes code for setting up a combination 'lock' based on a cigar box and some contact switches as a component of a scavenger hunt for a kid's birthday party. In this puzzle, kids can change the slider switches, based on an earlier clue. Once the right switches are in place and the box lid is closed, the CPX will play a "ta-da!" sound.
